### Adding new data to US State Income Tax Dashboard

Using the resources provided by the instructor, I was able to find a datatset related to tax and I made a few edits to a add a new field to the already existing Income Tax Dashboard.
The field added was named Hosehold Income Distribution and it is a responsive row that brings results after the form in the dashboard has been siubmitted.
